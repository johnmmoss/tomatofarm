      <h3>
        The tomato technique is more commonly known as the pomodoro technique
      </h3>
      <p>
        It was pioneered by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Francesco used a
        timer shaped as a tomato to count the time periods which is where the
        name came from.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Software Development industry popularised the technique further
        through the extreme programming and software craftsmanship movements.
      </p>

      <p>
        I came across the technique during a workshop on Deliberate Practice run
        by Jon Jagger and Kevlin Henney and started using it to be more
        productive in my working day.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have found the tomato technique to be very useful and chatted about it
        with friends referring to the number of tomatoes I had completed each
        day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whilst my presentation of the tomato technique might seem quite
        informal, it is actually a highly structured approach to work which
        relies on the following
      <ul>
        <li>Having a structured list of work to be completed.</li>
        <li>Committing to short bursts of activity.</li>
        <li>Tracking the work completed.</li>
        <li>Being able to visualize the work completed.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
